# Task Breakdown: Automated Gallery Management System

> **Issue**: #1 - Automate Image Gallery Management
> **Spec**: automated-gallery-management.md
> **Total Effort**: 5-8 hours

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Preparation (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Create feature branch**
  - Branch name: `feature/automated-gallery-management`
  - Ensure clean working directory before starting

- [ ] **Backup current implementation**
  - Copy `gallery.js` to `gallery.js.backup`
  - Document current hardcoded array count (177 images)

- [ ] **Set up development environment**
  - Ensure Node.js dependencies installed (`npm install`)
  - Test current image processing workflow
  - Verify gallery functionality works before changes

### Phase 2: Manifest Generation Implementation (2-3 hours)

- [ ] **Modify robust-image-processor.js**
  - Add manifest generation function after image processing loop
  - Extract contributor names from filenames
  - Generate JSON with image metadata (filename, contributor, timestamp)
  - Write manifest to `optimized-images/manifest.json`
  - Add error handling for file write operations

- [ ] **Update package.json scripts**
  - Enhance `robust-process` script with manifest generation logging
  - Add validation step to ensure manifest is created successfully

- [ ] **Create helper functions**
  ```javascript
  // Functions to add to robust-image-processor.js
  function extractContributor(filename) { /* ... */ }
  function generateManifest(processedImages) { /* ... */ }
  function writeManifest(manifest) { /* ... */ }
  ```

### Phase 3: Gallery.js Refactoring (2-3 hours)

- [ ] **Replace hardcoded imageFiles array**
  - Remove lines 20-178 (hardcoded array)
  - Implement dynamic manifest loading in `loadImages()` method
  - Add fetch() call to load `optimized-images/manifest.json`
  - Transform manifest data to existing image object format

- [ ] **Add error handling**
  - Handle manifest loading failures gracefully  
  - Display user-friendly error messages
  - Implement fallback behavior (empty gallery with message)
  - Add retry mechanism for network failures

- [ ] **Implement loading states**
  - Show loading spinner during manifest fetch
  - Update gallery counter with loaded image count
  - Hide gallery grid until images are loaded

- [ ] **Add performance optimizations**
  - Lazy loading for gallery grid images
  - Preload next few slideshow images
  - Optimize memory usage during slideshow

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features (1-2 hours)

- [ ] **Improve contributor attribution**
  - Smart detection of contributor names from filenames
  - Support multiple contributors per image
  - Display contributor information in modal
  - Handle edge cases (unknown contributors, special naming)

- [ ] **Add metadata support**
  - Include processing timestamp in manifest
  - Support custom image titles and descriptions
  - Preserve original filename information
  - Add image count validation

- [ ] **Performance monitoring**
  - Add console logging for load times
  - Monitor memory usage during slideshow
  - Track gallery initialization performance
  - Add metrics for large collections (1000+ images)

## Testing Tasks

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (1-2 hours)

- [ ] **Unit Testing**
  - Test manifest generation with various image sets
  - Validate JSON structure and content
  - Test contributor extraction accuracy
  - Verify error handling scenarios

- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Test complete workflow: pics/ → robust-process → gallery display
  - Verify all existing functionality works unchanged
  - Test with current 177-image collection
  - Test slideshow timing and navigation

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - Measure gallery load time with current image set
  - Test with simulated large collections (1000+ images)
  - Monitor browser memory usage during slideshow
  - Verify smooth transitions and responsiveness

- [ ] **Error Scenario Testing**
  - Delete manifest.json and test error handling
  - Test with malformed JSON
  - Test with missing images referenced in manifest
  - Test network failure scenarios

### Phase 6: Browser Compatibility (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**
  - Chrome (primary development browser)
  - Safari (iOS compatibility)
  - Firefox (standards compliance)
  - Mobile browsers (responsive behavior)

- [ ] **Accessibility Testing**
  - Keyboard navigation still works
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Loading state announcements
  - Error message accessibility

## Deployment Tasks

### Phase 7: Deployment Preparation (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Code Review**
  - Self-review all changes
  - Ensure no hardcoded values remain
  - Verify error handling completeness
  - Check performance optimization implementation

- [ ] **Documentation Updates**
  - Update README.md with new workflow
  - Document manifest.json structure
  - Add troubleshooting section
  - Update development setup instructions

### Phase 8: Production Deployment (30 minutes)

- [ ] **Final Testing**
  - Test in production-like environment
  - Verify GitHub Pages compatibility
  - Test complete workflow end-to-end
  - Confirm all acceptance criteria met

- [ ] **Deployment**
  - Merge feature branch to main
  - Monitor deployment to GitHub Pages
  - Verify live site functionality
  - Test with family members for usability

- [ ] **Post-deployment Validation**
  - Add new test photos and verify workflow
  - Monitor site performance
  - Gather feedback from users
  - Document any issues for future improvements

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### High-Priority Safeguards
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Keep backup of working gallery.js for quick revert
- [ ] **Staging Testing**: Test all changes in development before production
- [ ] **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy in phases with testing at each step
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for site availability and performance

### Success Validation
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Verification**
  - New photos automatically appear after processing
  - No manual array editing required
  - Complete workflow under 2 minutes
  - All existing functionality preserved
  - Performance acceptable with large collections

## Next Steps

1. **Review this task breakdown** with stakeholders
2. **Estimate actual time** for each phase based on developer experience
3. **Set up development environment** and create feature branch
4. **Begin with Phase 1 preparation** tasks
5. **Execute phases sequentially** with testing at each step

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours over 2-3 development sessions
**Target Completion**: Within 1 week of starting development
